After the user clicks to begin a new quiz they will be able to start up a new personality quiz instance.
The quiz will make use of the Traitify API to present an image/personality trait pair, which a user will be able to indicate as either descriptive of them, or not.
Upon selecting one of these options, a user is presented a new question in the same style, until the completion of the test.
After the user is done with the quiz, they will be redirected to the view results page.
