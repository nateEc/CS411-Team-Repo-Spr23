As a returning user, I want to be able to access my previous favorited movies in a logical and easy manner. I want the site to provide
me with a clear and chronological list of all my previous favorite movies on my dashboard page, so I can quickly review my selections,
without having to search for them. I want each summary on the list to include the date the movie was favoritied, the name of the movies, and a quick synoposis. When I click on a summary, I want the site to bring me to a page with more detailed information about the movie, including ratings, staring actors, and access to the movie trailer. I want this page to be easy to read and navigate,
with clear headings and a well-organized layout. After I have finished reviewing my favorited mvoies, I want to be able to easily navigate
back to my dashboard page, so that I can continue using the site. I want the site to provide a clear and easy-to-use navigation menu that
allows me to quickly switch between different pages and features, without having to go back to the homepage every time.
