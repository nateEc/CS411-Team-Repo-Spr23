As a returning user, I want to be able to easily access all the available features of the site, so that I can quickly get to the
information I need without having to search around the site. A potential problem I am concerned with is if I find myself having to
navigate through multiple pages and menus just to get to the page I need, which wastes my time and is frustrating. I would like to
see all the available features integrated into one place, such as a dashboard, so that I can quickly and easily access everything
I need. This dashboard should have clear and easy-to-understand icons or buttons for each feature, so that I can quickly find and
use the functionality I need. For example, I should be able to log-in/log-out, go to the homepage, and go to my profile page to see my past favorited movies, all from the dashboard. This will save me time and make the site more user-friendly. I want the site to provide me
with an intuitive and straightforward user experience, so that I can easily find the information I need and use the site's features
to their fullest potential. I don't want to waste time searching for the features I need, so having everything integrated in one
place will make my experience much more enjoyable and efficient.

In the account overview, a user that is logged in will be able to simultaneously view all available options to them, including
searching up new favorite movies to add to their local list and viewing their profile page with all their past favorited movies.
