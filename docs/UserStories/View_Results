Upon the completion of a quiz (New Quiz), a user is greeted with the results of the quiz.
These results will be presented as a set of 5 top recommendations of movies, which are visually presented to the user.
The user at this point will have the ability to select and remove a title in the set if they have seen or donâ€™t like the suggestion, by simply clicking a relevant button.
From this point a user will be expected to continue back to the account overview.
The results from the recent quiz will be transferred to the old results section of the home page.
