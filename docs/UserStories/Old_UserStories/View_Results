Having completed a quiz, I want to view my quiz results to see which movies are recommended for me based on my personality traits.
I want the site to present my recommended movies visually and, because I do not want recommendations that I can’t use, allow me to
remove a movie if I have seen it or don't like the suggestion. After removing a movie, I want it to be replaced by a new recommendation
instead. When I am happy with the recommendations, I want to be immediately redirected back to my account overview page so that I can
continue using the site.

Upon the completion of a quiz (New Quiz), a user is greeted with the results of the quiz. These results will be presented as a set of
5 top recommendations of movies, which are visually presented to the user. The user at this point will have the ability to select and
remove a title in the set if they have seen or don’t like the suggestion, by simply clicking a relevant button. From this point a user
will be expected to continue back to the dashboard. The results from the recent quiz will be transferred to the old results section of
the home page. Upon the completion of a quiz (New Quiz), a user is greeted with the results of the quiz.
