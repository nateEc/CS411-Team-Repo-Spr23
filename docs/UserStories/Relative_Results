I want to compare my personality test results with other users on the site. I want the site to provide a feature that allows me to
view how my personality test results compare to other users' results. This feature will enable me to better understand how my personality
traits are unique and how they are similar to others. I want the comparison feature to be easily accessible on the dashboard page, where
I can see an overview of my results and compare them with other users' results. The comparison should be presented in a clear and visually
appealing way, with charts or graphs that highlight similarities and differences. By using this feature, I will be able to gain insights
into how my personality traits affect my movie recommendations compared to others on the site. This feature will allow me to feel more
connected to the community of users on the site and help me understand myself better.

On the dashboard page a user will be able to view an information section informing them of the top recommended movie results site wide
based on their previous results of the personality tests.
On the account overview page a user will be able to view an information section.
This will inform them of the top recommended movie results site wide,
