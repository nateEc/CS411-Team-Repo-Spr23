## Idea 1
### Scheduler 
Take in userâ€™s regular calendar (This includes classes and other events that are usually in their daily schedule)
They will be able to add events that they would like to do, and they can include:
 - If it's something they want to do within the day/week/month
 - Include the amount of time they think it will take
 - Where they need to go for it
 
 
After list of event they need to do is added we include thoses tasks into their calendar.

Based on weather forecasts, travel time, and other factors -- we will fit those events into their calendar

## Idea 2
### Personality Test and Movie Recommendations 
User takes a quiz and using personality test api -- specifically the movie traits one (includes Believer, Dramatic, Indie, Laughaholic, NailBiter, Romantic, and Stunt Double).

Based on their results, we match their personality result types to movie types of similar genres.
We'll give them a recommendation list sorted by percentage of what is most like their personality type.

We can even give them similar reccomendation based on the movie that they match with, with other types of media, such as tv shows, music, games, and books.

## Final Project Idea
### Favorite Movie Database and Search
Users can look up any of their favorite movies using the TMDB api and add these movies to their favorites, which they can access on their profile page.

In the search page or going to their store favorite movies, they can get access to some of that movie's information and be redirected to the trailer of that movie, using Youtube's api.
