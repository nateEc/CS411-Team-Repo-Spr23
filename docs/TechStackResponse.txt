Node -  Since it is built on JavaScript we are able to access many open software resources. This provides us with many easy-to-follow tutorials and resources to help us create more complicated pieces without having to rough it out on our own. It also lets us do asynchronous code, we are able to activate multiple tasks at the same time without blocking/having to wait for it to finish before we are able to move on to the next piece. 
Express.js - Expressâ€™s ability to create complex routes which allows us to use routers so we can easily connect our front end and take in those HTTP requests easily, such as GET, POST, and PUSH. This will be helpful with our API calls. We also researched that it is easy to connect with databases, such as MongoDB which we expect to be using to store our user data. It also gave us an easy framework to start with and provides a level of abstraction through its middleware architecture
