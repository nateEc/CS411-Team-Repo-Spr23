## Idea 1
###scheduler 
Take in user’s regular calendar → including classes and other events (daily schedule)
They should be able to add events that they would like to do
Either sometime during the day/week/month
Include the amount of time they think it would take
Where they need to go for it
…
After list of event they need to do is added we include thoses tasks into their calendar
Based on weather forecasts, travel time, <other factors here> we fit those events into their calendar
